```commandline
ant -buildfile textdecorators/src/build.xml all
```
The above command compiles your code and generates .class files inside the BUILD folder.

## Description:

Program to implement Text Decorators pattern :

Provide justification for Data Structures used in this assignment in term of Big O complexity (time and/or space):

1.List :
To insert a data into ArrayList it take always a constant time O(1) operation.
To get a data from ArrayList it take always a constant time O(1) operation.
indexOf() â€“ also runs in linear time. It iterates through the internal array and checking each element one by one. So the time complexity for this operation always requires O(n) time


2.Map

LinkedHashMap - I have used LinkedHashMap to find the most frequent word. LinkedHashMap has complexity of O(1) for insertion and lookup.
 
3.Display
I have used list data structure in result class to store the final result. Complexity to add element is O(n).
